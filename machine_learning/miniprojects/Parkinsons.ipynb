    "The dataset was created by Max Little of the University of Oxford, in collaboration with the National Centre for Voice and Speech, Denver, Colorado, who recorded the speech signals. The original study published the feature extraction methods for general voice disorders.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Set Information\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column in the table is a particular voice measure, and each row corresponds one of 195 voice recording from these individuals (\"name\" column). The main aim of the data is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to \"status\" column which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is in ASCII CSV format. The rows of the CSV file contain an instance corresponding to one voice recording. There are around six recordings per patient, the name of the patient is identified in the first column.For further information or to pass on comments, please contact Max Little (littlem '@' robots.ox.ac.uk).\n",
